Hello! I'm Brandon! I am currently studying Full Stack through FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design program. When I am not coding, I am a geek who loves pretty much anything you can name, such as technology, video games, DnD and Warhammer 40k (Even though I have sadly never played, I just enjoy watching campaigns and lore on YouTube).
