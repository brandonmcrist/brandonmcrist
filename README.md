Hello! My name is Brandon Crist. From a young age, my heart has always been in the Technology field. I was fortunate that my father ran a computer repair store where I worked side by side with my father to diagnose issues and provided appropriate solutions. From that experience, I learned to love troubleshooting issues and solving problems.
